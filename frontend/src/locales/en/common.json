  "faq_title": "FAQ",
  "faq_heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_description": "Here you can find answers to the most common questions about Hans AI Coach.",
  "faq_1_question": "What is Hans AI Coach?",
  "faq_1_answer": "Hans is your personal AI-powered League of Legends coach. He analyzes your games in real-time, tracks your performance, and gives you personalized tips to help you climb faster.",
  "faq_2_question": "How does the AI coaching work?",
  "faq_2_answer": "The AI analyzes your game data – including kills, deaths, assists, map movements, and item builds – and generates personalized improvement suggestions based on pro strategies and best practices.",
  "faq_3_question": "Do I need a subscription?",
  "faq_3_answer": "No, currently no subscription is required. Hans AI Coach is in beta and is fully free to use. Later there will be different pricing tiers depending on how many games you track and how deep the coaching analysis goes.",
  "faq_4_question": "Can I cancel my account or future subscriptions anytime?",
  "faq_4_answer": "Yes, absolutely! Once the paid version is activated, you can manage and cancel your account or subscription anytime directly from your dashboard.",
  "faq_5_question": "Is my data safe?",
  "faq_5_answer": "Yes! All your game and personal data is securely transmitted and stored according to modern privacy standards. Your data belongs exclusively to you.",
  "faq_6_question": "Why is it a .exe file?",
  "faq_6_answer": "Windows Defender may show a warning because the application currently has no official code certification. This costs 350–500 €. Since I'm a student and developing Hans AI Coach as a solo project, I currently can't afford this. The software is safe.",
  "faq_7_question": "Is the program really free?",
  "faq_7_answer": "Yes! In the current beta version, Hans AI Coach is completely free. You can test all core features and give feedback to improve development. In the future, there will be a fair pricing model with different tiers.",
  "faq_8_question": "Can I get banned for using it?",
  "faq_8_answer": "No. Our software does not violate Riot Games rules. We act like a normal live coach: analysis happens outside the game, without interacting with the client or gameplay. We only use the official Riot API, which Riot explicitly allows. Therefore, a ban is impossible.",
